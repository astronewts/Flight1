CHORES LEFT TO DO:
*********************************************
- Create Command/Error Log 
- Camera period functions as the OFF time.  Correct to be Time ON and Period.
- ERROR Flag for "Too much data" per the allocated word size.


Bugs to Look into/General Questions:
*********************************************
- Pressure is not being read 12 bits in Software
- digitalRead(PIN_PYRO_1_FIRE) == HIGH) -> its an output, not sure if you can read an output without changing it to an input
- Double-check: Altitude Sanity Low Limit applicability (situational)
- Charging (OR for low volt/cap, AND high volt/cap) under 
- FIX inconsistent current charging in command receipt logic (???)
- Check the calibration curves 0 to max counts, & cross reference with the sanity check values



Nice to have updates:
- Should use different variables for TCS and EPS (value)?
- Discuss & determine whether we want AmpHr Charge discharge voltage to have precedence: 
- Add Parity Check Error Flag TLM
- Heavy(?) cleaning of gyro/gps modules output
- FUTURE NOTE: figure out if we need to pad the zeros on the end of the Rockblock output word
- implement "parity error counter" -> definition in there. 
- Finalize GPS & GYRO struct in Definitions.  Also, think about adding EPS struct
- Fix ordering error in the Battery Voltage section of TLM processing
- Move Valid_str calc upstream of Rockblock word (and other items that can be more global.
- Need delay between enable & fire {Not sure this is really needed}


Questions for Marvin:
- BUFFER LOG!!!
- Do all the timers just immediately start counting on their own?

Individual Task Items
*********************************************
- Pressure is not being read 12 bits in Software
- Check the calibration curves 0 to max counts, & cross reference with the sanity check values
- Do all the timers just immediately start counting on their own?
- digitalRead(PIN_PYRO_1_FIRE) == HIGH) -> its an output, not sure if you can read an output without changing it to an input
- Should use different variables for TCS and EPS (value)?
- Change names for "low voltage" and "voltage power limit low"
- Discuss & determine whether we want AmpHr Charge discharge voltage to have precedence: 
- Camera period functions as the OFF time.  We should decide whether if this the case or not.
- implement "parity error counter" -> definition in there. 
- Double-check: Altitude Sanity Low Limit applicability (situational)
- Charging (OR for low volt/cap, AND high volt/cap) under 
- Make sure everything is 12 bit (and update wording to reflect such)
- Finalize GPS & GYRO struct in Definitions.  Also, think about adding EPS struct
- Move Valid_str calc upstream of Rockblock word
- Create Command/Error Log 
- Fix ordering error in the Battery Voltage section of TLM processing
- Heavy(?) cleaning of gyro/gps modules output
- ERROR Flag for "Too much data" per the allocated word size.
- FUTURE NOTE: figure out if we need to pad the zeros on the end of the Rockblock output word
- Add Parity Check Error Flag TLM
- FIX inconsistent current charging in command receipt logic
- Need delay between enable & fire
